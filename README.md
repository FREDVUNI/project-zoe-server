# About project Angie

Angie is a church management centered on what's at the heart of all ministry - people. The platform simplifies the process of managing people and their relationships between each other and the church, keeping track of data across the organization and creates a foundation for adding new features that are specific to your church.

# The tech

4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.sample`.

    Set these environment variables in the `env` file as follows

## Github Action
This repo is automatically deployed to the prod server using github actions. We create an `.env` file during the deployment process. Rather than add each environment variable to the file one by one, we copied a complete `.env` file and encrypted it using base64. We use the command:

```
openssl base64 -A -in .env -out .env.prod.encrypted
```

We then get the contents of `.env.prod.encrypted` and add them as a Github Action variable called `PROD_ENV_FILE`
